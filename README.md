## Analysis Overview: 
The goal of the analysis was to analyze the testing data regarding all the high schools (grades 9-12) in PyCity School District. The testing dataset included testing resukts from the mathmantics and reading comprehension testing. The schools that we provide infromation for the following: passing percentages (by school and grade), budget inquiries,school sizing, and type. Below I will go in depth about the findings I was able to  uncover. 
Please keep in mind the finding needed to be reprocess due to the omission for the testing results for the Thomas High School grade 9 students. I make comparisions about both analysis I performs for this school district. 

## Results: 
* The distict sumary was affected in every catergory but one, which was the average reading score. The passing reading score experienced the largest decrease by 0.3% with the omission of grade 9 Thomas High School scores.

* The other school were not affected due to the fact that their nine grade scores were still accounted for and used. 

    * The Budget per student figures were shown  to be miminally impacted by the difference of cents of the amount.
    * Thomas High School is classified as a charter school.The scores by school only affected the charter school figures.  Please see below:
